## Occupation

`2018-2020`
__Standard Cognition__, San Francisco, CA

- Tracking systems for computer vision
- Statistical techniques for processing output of a deep learning system

`2012-2018`
__Oblong Industries__, Los Angeles, CA

- Natural UI / Gestural interaction
- Realtime visual effects
- Multi-machine display walls
- Creative coding
- Development in support of vision, motion, and interaction design

where I am credited as "Effects Engineer, Visual Effects"

Many of the projects here were short-turnaround, graphics intensive, and
developed in tight collaboration with designers/artists.  In support of this
we developed a set of tools to allow rapid iteration of custom effects which
could be added to a project later, or tweaked once they landed in a project.
Among them were a DSL-driven rendering component that started out as a
DSL-initialized shader-driven particle system (but that quickly morphed into
a generic parametric mesh renderer) and a system that rendered the contents
of an sqlite database by tying column names in an SQL query to per-vertex
attributes in a vertex shader.  Each of these could be dynamically
re-initialized by data sent over a network (so effects written with them
could be live-coded, or live-tweaked while sitting side-by-side with a
designer).

I was also able to use some of my control theory background to write a
quick-and-dirty controls-inpsired reactive animation system that guaranteed
C1 continuity while handling asynchronous "go to waypoint" commands.
A nice innovation here was a math trick that allowed the system to remain
numerically stable with an animation time step synchronized to the rendering
time step.


`2010-2012`
__Google__, Irvine, CA

`2009-2010`
__Hooked Wireless__, Cupertino, CA

- Computer graphics for embedded systems
- Conformance tests for OpenCL
- Variety of special projects
- Developed shader effects to mimic effects rendered in an offline movie
on an embedded GPU in a car dashboard.
